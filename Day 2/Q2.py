# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight 
#and height.
# BMI Wikipedia Page
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. 
#e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short 
#person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of 
#their height (in m):
#BMI = weight(kg)/heightxheight(mxm)
# NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number
# in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.
# Example Input 1
# 1.75
# 80
# means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75
# Example Output 1
# 26
# Since: 80 รท (1.75 ร 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

height = input()
weight = input()

weight_as_int = int(weight)
height_as_float = float(height)

bmi = weight_as_int/height_as_float ** 2

bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
print(bmi_as_int)
